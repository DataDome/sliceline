Sliceline
=========

Sliceline is a Python library for fast slice finding for Machine
Learning model debugging.

It is an implementation of `SliceLine: Fast, Linear-Algebra-based Slice
Finding for ML Model
Debugging <https://mboehm7.github.io/resources/sigmod2021b_sliceline.pdf>`__,
from Svetlana Sagadeeva and Matthias Boehm of Graz University of
Technology.

👉 Getting started
-----------------

Given an input dataset ``X`` and a model error vector ``errors``,
SliceLine finds the top slices in ``X`` that identify where a ML model
performs significantly worse.

You can use sliceline as follows:

.. code:: python

   from sliceline.slicefinder import Slicefinder

   slice_finder = Slicefinder()

   slice_finder.fit(X, errors)

   print(slice_finder.top_slices_)

   X_trans = slice_finder.transform(X)

We invite you to check the `demo

🛠 Installation
--------------

Sliceline is intended to work with **Python 3.9 or above**. Installation
can be done with ``pip``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install sliceline

There are `wheels
available <https://pypi.org/project/sliceline/#files>`__ for Linux,
MacOS, and Windows, which means that you most probably won’t have to
build Sliceline from source.

You can install the latest development version from GitHub as so:

.. code:: sh

   pip install git+https://github.com/datadome/sliceline --upgrade

Or, through SSH:

.. code:: sh

   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/datadome/sliceline.git --upgrade
